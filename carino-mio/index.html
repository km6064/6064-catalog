                <p>‘Cariño Mío’ is a contemporary interpretation of a classic, passive ribbon microphone. It is designed with simplicity, modularity, and long-term repairability in mind, without compromising on sound quality.</p>
                <p>The microphone has a single central assembly, CNC machined from aluminium that houses the ribbon motor, transformer and output XLR. The ridges annd grooves on the monolithic nylon body provide both functional alignment of the assembly, and easy alignent of the ribbon center for stereo microphone alignment. </p>

                <h3><strong>Development - Ribbon Design</strong></h3>
                <p>A basic, custom corrugator was used to test different ribbon qualities, thicknesses and lengths alongside various magnets, transformers and motor designs.</p>
                <p>Whilst not an ideal solution for a final implemention and tuning, it allowed for componant matching and worked well to produce functional prototypes for listening tests.</p>
                <p>Ultimately a 1.8 micron aluminium foil ribbon and a pair of N42 Neodymium magnets were chosen to pair with a Lundahl transformer</p>

                <p>There are plans to produce a small batch of fully assembled and finished microphones as well as a DIY kit with provided STL files for 3D printing to allow for experimentation.</p>

                <h3><strong>Finishing and Sound</strong></h3>
                <p>The final body and hood is 3D printed using high quality Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) from PA12 Nylon, with a shot peen polished finish. The process and material was chosen for durability and toughness but also for this combination's ability to closely match the intended CAD model, which is crucial due to the design's tight tolerances.</p>

                <p>The single piece motor assembly is CNC machined from aluminium. Since the transformer, XLR, magnets and all wiring mounts directly to the motor mount, CNC aluminium was the obvious choice for rigidity, longevity and aesthetics. A full 3D printed assembly was also tested and is perfectly suitable as a lower cost option</p>

                <p>The outer body has a professionally sprayed Nextel® Suede finish. This is a beautiful, tactile finish that provides a premium, matte feel with slight texture</p>
